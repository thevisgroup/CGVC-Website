We’re pleased to announce that the registration for {{page.year}} is now open.

<br>
For the very first time CGVC 2026 is co-located with the larger Eurovis 2026 conference. CGVC normally runs over 2 days (Thu+Fri), whereas Eurovis normally takes place over 5 days (Mon-Fri).   As such, CGVC delegates have three registration options:

<br>
1.  The Full Week includes both conferences (5 days, Monday-Friday), CGVC and Eurovis, all evening social events (Welcome Reception, Guided Tour, Eurovis Party, Conference Dinner), all coffee and tea breaks, lunches, and Monday workshops.

<br>
2.  The Eurovis Conference Week includes (4 days, Tuesday-Friday) CGVC and Eurovis, evening social events (Guided Tour, Eurovis Party, Conference Dinner), coffee and tea breaks, lunches (no Monday workshops or Welcome Reception).

<br>
3.  CGVC 2026 Only (2 days, Thursday+Friday): includes coffee and tea breaks, lunches, and the conference dinner. CGVC being co-located with Eurovis is a once in a lifetime occurrence. We encourage delegates to register for the full week to get the most of this experience.
