### Dr Narges Mahyar:
[Dr Narges Mahyar](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/nmahyar/) is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at City St George’s, University of London, and a 2024–2025 Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University. Previously, she was an Associate Professor at the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her research lies at the intersection of visualization, human–computer interaction, social computing, and design, with a central focus on visualization for collective empowerment. She designs and studies human-centered AI and visualization systems that enable both experts and communities to reason together, navigate uncertainty, and make informed decisions in complex sociotechnical settings. Over the past decade, her work has advanced the field of Digital Civics, developing community-centered technologies that scale public participation in high-stakes domains such as climate risk, urban planning, and civic decision-making. Her research has been recognized with nine Best Paper and Honorable Mention awards at leading HCI and visualization venues. Narges holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Victoria and completed postdoctoral research at the University of British Columbia and the University of California, San Diego.
