### Dr Gurprit Singh:
[Dr Gurprit Singh](https://sampling.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) is a Principal Member of Technical Staff at AMD, where he works at the intersection of rendering, optimization, and generative AI. Prior to joining AMD, he was a Senior Researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~gsingh/) in Germany, where he led a research group in visual computing. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Lyon 1, France, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship from an Ivy League college (Dartmouth College) in the USA. He holds a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Gurprit's research focuses on bridging the gaps between physically based rendering, probabilistic inference, and generative models, with a particular emphasis on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods as a unifying framework.

### Abstract:
Noise has long been a fundamental building block in computer graphics, shaping textures, patterns, and realism across decades. In this keynote, we trace the evolution of noise — spanning from the art of stippling to physically based rendering. We then transition to the transformative role of noise in modern generative AI, where (correlated) noise scheduling has become a silent yet powerful lever in shaping image generation. We will explore how adjusting noise schedules can dramatically alter generated outputs without retraining or fine-tuning, revealing surprising artistic and technical "control" over deep generative models. This talk will take you to a journey through the visual and mathematical evolution of noise — the invisible hand behind the modern generative AI tools.

### Professor Min Chen
[Min Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/mchen) is a professor of scientific visualization at the [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/min-chen/) and a fellow of Pembroke College. He built his academic career in Wales, particularly at Swansea University, where he rose from research officer to full professor. His research spans data visualization, computer graphics, and interdisciplinary applications, with over 200 publications. Chen has held key editorial and leadership roles in major visualization conferences and journals, and played a significant role in pandemic modeling through the RAMPVIS project. He is a fellow of several prestigious professional societies.

### Abstract:
In the field of visualization and visual analytics, there are a number of schools of thought, most of which
represent different believes about why visualization works, what makes a good visualization, and how
visualization should be designed and evaluated. While having such schools of thought indicates a level
of scholarly maturity, the different opinions and inconsistent wisdoms suggest the necessity for further
theoretical discourses, empirical experimentation, and practical validation. In this talk, the speaker will
use information theory to analyze several major schools of thought, including insightism (e.g., “providing
insight about data”), cognitivism (e.g., “amplifing human cognition”), communicationism (e.g., “helping
tell stories”), and economism (e.g., data-ink ratio). The speaker will also briefly discuss how this form
of information-theoretical analysis can be applied to other computational and cognitive processes, e.g.,
computer graphics, virtual reality, and machine learning.
