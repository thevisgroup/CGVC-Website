title: CGVC 2020 Call for Papers
---
<p>
  CGVC 2020, hosted by <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London in London UK</a>, is the 38th annual
  computer graphics, visualization, and visual
  computing gathering organized by the Eurographics UK Chapter. The objective of Computer Graphics & Visual Computing
  (CGVC) is to foster greater exchange between visual computing researchers and practitioners, and to draw more
  researchers and industry partners in the UK, Europe, and abroad to enter this rapidly growing area of research. CGVC
  has
  an expanded scope to include all areas of visual computing, and a steadily more wide-spread visibility that achieves a
  more wide-spread impact.
</p>

<p>
  We seek contributions in the form of full papers, short papers, viewpoint papers and extended abstracts (posters).
  Optional single-blind or double-blind - reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to
  anonymize their submission or not.
</p>

<h3>Full Papers</h3>
<p>
  A paper of up to 8 pages describing completed research, plus 1 page of references only. Papers are refereed, by
  members of the EGUK programme committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to give a 20-minute presentation at
  the conference. Accepted papers will appear in the Eurographics digital library and will serve as full paper
  publications
</p>

<h3>Short Papers</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of short papers is to present late-breaking results, work-in -progress, and follow-up extensions or
  evaluations of existing methods. Short papers will be peer-reviewed in a one-stage process by an international
  programme
  committee. They will be electronically archived and are fully citable publications. Submissions for the short paper
  track should be at most 4 pages, with an additional page allowed for references. Accepted short papers will be
  presented orally at the conference in (approximately) 12-15 minute presentations.
</p>

<h3>Viewpoint Papers</h3>
<p>
  CGVC also features a viewpoint paper track (also known as position paper) which
  enables researchers a new possibility to publish their ideas. Viewpoints articles offer detailed technical opinions
  on
  trends in visual computing or reports on how visual computing has contributed to the comprehension of data or
  phenomena. We encourage discussions of challenges or limitations in today's methods and areas of potential new
  topics
  of research. We are also interested in application discussions that focus on the physical, life or social sciences,
  engineering, or commerce, for example, or related to the process of visual computing in general. We encourage an
  emphasis on lessons learned from practical experience for application discussions, particularly where visual
  computing
  has been employed in a real, working environment. Viewpoint papers are submitted with author names and affiliations.
  Accepted viewpoint papers will be electronically archived, are fully citable publications and will be presented
  orally
  at the conference in (approximately) 12-15 minute presentations.
</p>

<h3>Extended Abstracts / Posters</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of this track is to present late-breaking results, work
  in progress, and follow-up extensions or evaluations of existing methods. In particular, it provides young
  researchers, especially postgraduate students, with valuable opportunities to receive feedback from other
  researchers,
  and engage in stimulating discussions. The poster track will be managed by the co-chair team and the International
  Programme Committee (IPC). We solicit poster submissions in the form of an extended abstract of at most 2 pages (with
  an
  additional page allowed for references only).
  Posters will be peer-reviewed in a one-stage process. Accepted posters, size A1 recommended, will be presented at
  the
  poster viewing session of the conference.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to directly submitted posters, some submissions to the full, short and viewpoint paper tracks, that are
  not accepted for publication but are deemed suitable, will be offered an opportunity to be presented as posters.
  Such
  submissions will not require an additional review process.
</p>

<p>
  Traditionally, the materials in a poster/sketch can be reused later by the original authors for a more extensive
  publication (e.g., a full paper) with more detailed content and mature results. This should not be considered as
  self-plagiarism. However, as posters/sketches are citable, researchers are encouraged to acknowledge novel ideas and
  results presented in posters/sketches. A poster may describe a piece of work in any aspect of visual computing. For
  posters, we particularly encourage a summary report of collaborative projects, work-in-progress, and application
  case
  studies.
</p>

<p>
  Accepted abstracts do not appear in the Eurographics digital library. An extended abstract and industrial project
  abstract are not be considered as a paper publication, instead being similar to a SIGGRAPH one‐page sketch or to a
  conference poster without an associated paper. As such, presenting an extended abstract at this conference has no
  effect on your ability to publish a fuller version of the same work in another venue.
