- **Gurprit Singh** Gurprit Singhis a Principal Member of Technical Staff at AMD, where he works at the intersection of rendering, optimization, and generative AI. Prior to joining AMD, he was a Senior Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany, where he led a research group in visual computing. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Lyon 1, France, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship from an Ivy League college (Dartmouth College) in the USA. He holds a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Gurprit's research focuses on bridging the gaps between physically based rendering, probabilistic inference, and generative models, with a particular emphasis on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods as a unifying framework.
- **Abstract** Noise has long been a fundamental building block in computer graphics, shaping textures, patterns, and realism across decades. In this keynote, we trace the evolution of noise — spanning from the art of stippling to physically based rendering. We then transition to the transformative role of noise in modern generative AI, where (correlated) noise scheduling has become a silent yet powerful lever in shaping image generation. We will explore how adjusting noise schedules can dramatically alter generated outputs without retraining or fine-tuning, revealing surprising artistic and technical "control" over deep generative models. This talk will take you to a journey through the visual and mathematical evolution of noise — the invisible hand behind the modern generative AI tools.
