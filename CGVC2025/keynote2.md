- **Gurprit Singh** Gurprit Singhis a Principal Member of Technical Staff at AMD, where he works at the intersection of rendering, optimization, and generative AI. Prior to joining AMD, he was a Senior Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany, where he led a research group in visual computing. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Lyon 1, France, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship from an Ivy League college (Dartmouth College) in the USA. He holds a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Gurprit's research focuses on bridging the gaps between physically based rendering, probabilistic inference, and generative models, with a particular emphasis on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods as a unifying framework.
- **Abstract** Noise has long been a fundamental building block in computer graphics, shaping textures, patterns, and realism across decades. In this keynote, we trace the evolution of noise — spanning from the art of stippling to physically based rendering. We then transition to the transformative role of noise in modern generative AI, where (correlated) noise scheduling has become a silent yet powerful lever in shaping image generation. We will explore how adjusting noise schedules can dramatically alter generated outputs without retraining or fine-tuning, revealing surprising artistic and technical "control" over deep generative models. This talk will take you to a journey through the visual and mathematical evolution of noise — the invisible hand behind the modern generative AI tools.



### By Train
- Liverpool has a dedicated Merseyrail train line that can help you get to different parts of the city and over to the Wirral. Reach Liverpool Lime Street or Moorfields, for a 11 minute walk.
For long distance travel, there are many direct services from major cities around the UK, such as Manchester, Birmingham, London and Crewe.
From Liverpool Lime Street it is a short 11-minute walk to Byrom Street Campus.

### By Plane:
- If arriving at Liverpool John Lennon Airport it will take approximately 20 minutes via a taxi, or if you wish to travel by bus, you can take the 500 bus straight into Liverpool City Centre on Elliot Street right by Liverpool Lime Street for 40 minutes approx. From there it is a short 11-minute walk to Byrom Street Campus.
